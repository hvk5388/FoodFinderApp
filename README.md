A breakdown of which members of your team contributed to the sprint and in what ways:

We all assisted each other with errors, learning git, and merging clean up. We are very proud of what we accomplished as a team. Specifically the breakdown is: 

Hannah Kern worked on the notes page including myNotes.html, sendNotes.html, notes.js, and notesStyles.css. Hannah also worked on a good portion of app.js.

Taylor Bracone worked on the restaurants page, home/index page, and the settings page. This includes restaurants.html, index.html, settings.html, restaurants.js, index.js, settings.js, restaurantStylesheet.css, settings.css, and style.css. Taylor also added to some portions of app.js. She also assisted Ryan on some things pertaining to the favorites page.
